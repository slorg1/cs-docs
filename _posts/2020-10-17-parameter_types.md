title: To be or to be... the existential crisis of parameters

# {{page.title}}

By the end of the article, you will be able to tell the difference between these declarations and when to use which with discernment.

Python:
```python
def create_new_user(first_name, last_name, avatar=None,):
    ...
```
vs
```python
def create_new_user(first_name=None, last_name=None, avatar=None,):
    ...
```

TypeScript:
```typescript
interface User{
    firstName: string
    lastName: string
    avatar?
}
```
vs
```typescript
interface User{
    firstName: string
    lastName: string
    avatar: string|null
}
```

# A new understanding from the ground up in 2s

## Kinds of parameters
The kinds of parameters discussed in this post are:
* positional parameter: the parameter expects the argument to be given at the matching position
* keyword parameter: the parameter expects the argument to be given using the matching key
* optional/default parameter: the parameter expects the argument to be given using the matching key or omitted

I am glossing over the other kinds of parameters as at a high-level, they are declension of this subset applied to different use cases.

In Python:
```python
def my_function(
    pos_param_1,
    pos_param_2,
    *,
    kw_param_1,
    kw_param_2,
    optional_param_1="1",
    default_param_1=1,
):
    ...
```

In the same way in TS as an object, named parameter (React style function signature)
```typescript
interface Props{
    kw_param_1: string
    kw_param_2: string
    optional_param_1?: string
}
```
In the same way in TS as a function
```typescript
function myFunction(
    pos_param_1: string,
    pos_param_2: string,
    default_param_1=1,
    optional_param_1?: string,
) {
    // nothing to see here
}
```

## Wait a second... parameter or argument?
You may have seen these 2 concepts used interchangeably in the past. They are technically expressing 2 different "states" in the life-cycle of the same "thing".

The parameter is the name of the variable set at function or method declaration/definition time.

```python
def my_function(parameter_1, parameter_2):
    ...
```

The argument is the value that you pass the function/method at invocation time.

```python
my_function(
    "argument 1",
    "argument 2",
)
```

## What do I mean by semantic meaning?

The semantic meaning is the meaning (from Greek _sÄ“mantikos_ 'significant') of "something" has based on its relationship with others. More on the definition [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/semantics).

The salient point here is: what does the declaration of a variable mean beyond the syntactic and computational correctness?

# Semantic meaning of parameters

## Why does it even matter?

A thought that was shared to me by Tony Deigh (CTO of Jobcase) that stuck in my mind: "Code is read more than it is executed".

It meant that optimizing for execution is important but it is key to remember that code is read by other humans (mostly) and need to remain human-readable.

## Breaking it down

Taking this Python as an exhaustive example (the TS equivalent is the same):

```python
def my_function(
    pos_param_1,
    *,
    kw_param_1,
    optional_param_1="1",
    default_param_1=1,
):
    ...
```
Let's break down what we are told 1 parameter at a time:
* `pos_param_1`
* `kw_param_1`
* `optional_param_1`
* `default_param_1`

Take the TS class (named parameters) example:
```typescript
interface Props{
    kw_param_1: string;
    kw_param_2: string | null;
    optional_param_1?: string;
}
```

Let's break down what we are told 1 parameter at a time:
* `kw_param_1`:
* `kw_param_2`:
* `optional_param_1`:

# Acknowledgement

Before closing on the subject, I would like to bring up the key counter-arguments that I balance constantly in my mind assessing which strategy works best.

The argument goes as follows:

> I use keyword arguments _**systematically**_ to make my code more maintainable

I have seen 2 variations of how it comes to life.

### Some exclusively use it at invocation time and declare the parameters with a clear semantic meaning.
```python
def my_function(
    pos_param_1,
    *,
    optional_param_1="1",
    default_param_1=1,
):
    ...

my_function(
    pos_param_1="argument 1",
    optional_param_1="argument 2",
)
```
**pros**
* easier to add a parameter:
    * you do not need to add the argument for all invocation
    * the task ordering arguments is no longer applicable

**con**
* the arguments lose all semantic meaning: without reading the declaration of the function you cannot tell if an argument is needed or not: it hard to distinguish a bug (missing argument) from an intended declaration

### Some exclusively use it at invocation time and declaration time.
```python
def my_function(
    pos_param_1,
    *,
    optional_param_1="1",
    default_param_1=1,
    new_param=None,
):
    ...

my_function(
    pos_param_1="argument 1",
    optional_param_1="argument 2",
)
```
**pros**
* easier to add a parameter:
    * you do not need to add the argument for all invocation
    * the task ordering arguments is no longer applicable

**con**
* it is hard (if at all possible) to set sensible defaults
* the code in the function needs to handle the possible combinations (permutations do not matter:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) of supplied arguments: lead to lots of defensive programming or hoping for the best and dealing with consequences
* the arguments lose all semantic meaning: without reading the body of the function you cannot tell if an argument is needed or not

Now, you are in the know.

# Nota __very__ Bene
This post offers a stance on the semantic significance of the different kinds of parameters available in various languages.<br />
This stance reflects my personal approach to the matter.
